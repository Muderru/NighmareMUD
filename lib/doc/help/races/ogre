Ogres are strong, sturdy and semi-dexterous.  Their hideous looks have
given way to the human expression of calling ugly people ogres.
They are semi-dexterous and incredibly dim-witted.

Physical description:
Ogres are huge beings standing 2.5 meters tall and filling out every
centimeter on the way up.  Their lower jaws protrude from their face
with hideous pointy teeth sticking upwards out of their mouthes which
can never close.  They have a light blue skin, the kind of light blue
of a human who has died of suffocation.

Most common occupation: Fighter
