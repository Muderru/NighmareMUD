There is nothing spectacular about humans.  They are neither particularly
weak in any manner nor are they particularly strong in any respect.
Still, most other races find them reasonably attractive.

Physical description:
Human form is where the term "humanoid" comes from.  Humans have two
arms, two legs, and stand near two meters high.  Their skin comes in varying
shades from light tan to dark brown, with visible hair of all colours
only on the top of their heads.

Most common occupation: Monk
