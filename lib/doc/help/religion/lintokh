			       Lintokh

Lintokh is a horrid four-headed demon from an ancient elven
Underworld.  Most people do not believe in his existence, but an
extremely vicious sect of kataans just outside practice worship him as
their patron deity.

The kataans, and others who believe as those kataans do often engage
in the sacrifice of corpses to boost their mortal power.
