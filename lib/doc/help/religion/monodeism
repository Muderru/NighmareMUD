			      Monodeism

Monodeists are a sect of monks that believe in a single god that is
reality.  No one outside the sect is really sure what that means, and
they are not extremely forthcoming to outsiders on their beliefs.
Many other sects of monks feel that Monodeists are basically making it
up as they go along.

Monodeists do not engage in sacrifice.
