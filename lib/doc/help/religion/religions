			 Nightmare Religions

On Nightmare, religion reflects the metaphysical views your character
holds about the universe.  For faith-based classes, the religion is
the source of your power.  Exactly what each religion means varies
from religion to religion.  You may at any time convert to a new
religion, though for faith based classes to convert to religions
outside their class can be extremely negative.

A help file exists on all religions.
