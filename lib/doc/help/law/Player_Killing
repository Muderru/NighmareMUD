General player killing on Nightmare LPMud is against Nightmare law.
The penalty for this action may range from probation to exile.

Though it is against the fundamental philosophy of Nightmare to
legislate such mortal matters from the administrative level, allowing
mortals to handle the problem of player killing proved unmanageable
due to the fact that a few people took it beyond the gaming spirit of
Nightmare abd made player killing a tool of personal malice.

Limited player killing is allows in regions marked as arenas.  They
may be single rooms or entire areas.
