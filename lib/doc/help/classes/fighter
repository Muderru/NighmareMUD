Fighters are masters of the blade and general combat.  They spend
their entire lives training for battle or engaging in battle with the
mightiest foes they can find.  To them, there is no greater honour
than death in battle.  In group adventures, they often tend to protect
the team from the hostile enemies they encounter.  Of course, some
fighters themselves prove to be hostile, looking for combat from those
who mean them no ill will.

Fighter is definitely the class for those who like pure hack-n-slash.
It is the only class which is capable of engaging in serious combat
right at the start of things.  Of course, it is also the only class
where serious combat is a criterion for advancement.
