Kataans are the embodiment evil within this reality, worshipping any
number of evil gods.  Their powers derive from this faith in their
masters of doom, and their lives derive pleasure from causing misery
in the world.  Kataans enjoy a special harmony with the Underworld.

A kataan is very much a role-playing class that will probably be hard
to play due to the mix of combat and magic skills.  It is the only
class that mixes combat and magic to this degree.

Known class halls:
The Daroq Caves
