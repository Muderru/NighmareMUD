Fishers are masters of the sea, spending much of their time hauling in
meals for a hungry populace.  Within a team, fishers often work on
bringing in food on long quests to help satisfy the hunger of their
team.  In general, though, fishers spend a lot of time with other
fishers simply fishing away, telling tall stories, and looking for
that catch no one else has caught.

The fisher class is definitely not for the person who likes
hack-n-slash mudding.  Instead, it is designed for those who love to
role-play, and would like a role with character to play inside the
framework of a mud which is not purely role-playing.  Those who love
interacting with others might try entertaining fellow adventurers with
tales of fishing deeds.  Others may simply play the old hermit fisher
by the sea.
