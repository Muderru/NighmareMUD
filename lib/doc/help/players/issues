#1 I like having some sort of feedback on how I am progressing towards
advancing.

Fixed.  Type skills :)

#2 I hate having to suicide to get my character stats ok for my level.

We need more stuff in for customization of characters, which will
include a way to tweak stats without suiciding and praying for a
better roll.

#3 How about skills?

Skills will get you training points you can spend in training centres.
In other words, you might start out the game with 10000 training
points which you can spend in these centres until you get down to 0,
after which you have to earn every skill point.

#4 Not enough spells, a lot of old ones missing.

Yes, we will be continuously adding spells and general player
abilities.  Until then, it may be more difficult for magic using
classes to advance.  We also need to tweak how much skill experience
you get for spells.  It seems combat advances too fast, and spells too
slow.
