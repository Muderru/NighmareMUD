* wield <whatever> or wear <whatever> (and some other commands)
Sometimes this will result in seeing "which sword do you mean" when
you have only one sword.  The problem is that someone else in the
room, or perhaps the room itself, has a sword and it is confusing the
parser.  This bug should be fixed in a week.  A workaround is to go
into a room by yourself to wield it.

* The mud driver is still in alpha, menaing that from time to time it
will crash.  Since inventories now save, this really should not cause
you any inconveniences.  Our goal is to get the full release of the
MudOS driver as soon as it is available.  At that point we should
never crash.  It is always good practice to save when you acquire
something new, however, as saves only restore from the last time you
saw 'Autosave'.

* We need more help files written.
