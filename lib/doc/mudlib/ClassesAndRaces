			  Nightmare V Races and Classes

As of Nightmae IVr2.6, races and classes are fully configurable in
Nightmare without writing any code.  To create a new class or race,
simply create a new configuration file in /secure/cfg/classes or
/secure/cfg/races using the name of the class or race you wish to
create.  Nightmare comes ith example classes and races to show how the
configuration files should look.

Once you have completed a configuration file, use the addclass or
addrace command to add it.  The syntaxes are:
addclass
	addclass CLASSNAME
addrace
	addrace RACENAME [PLAYER FLAG]
where PLAYER FLAG is a 1 if you intend that class to be used by
players.

The next step is to create help files.  The Nightmare help system will
get vital information about the class or race from the classes or
races daemon.  You still need to provide a creative description
though.  Place this help in /doc/help/classes or /doc/help/races.
Then update /verbs/common/help.c

If you ever need to modify a class or race, use the removeclass and
removerace commands first, then add the class or race with the
modified data.
