The Nightmare V Object Library is designed to provide a modular
library of objects for the MudOS implementation of the LPC programming
language which allow people to easily build fantasy-based virtual
societies.

The basic objects around which this library centers are players,
non-player characters, creators, items, rooms, commands, and verbs.
Players are the intended audience of the end product.  The goal of
their participation is to provide them with a place in the virtual
society being built.  This means simply that there can be individual
goals to the playing of the game, and thus the object library should
support the creation of multiple game goals.

The primary measure of success of a player is advancement in the goals
the player has outlined for themselves.  A player outlines certain
narrow goals which are used for determining success by chosing a
class.  A class provides a player with a skill base used in
determining the player's success.

NPC's exist to enrich the virtual reality being built, not simply to
be punching bags for violent people.  To this end they should have
functionality which allows them to participate as menaingful members
of the reality.
