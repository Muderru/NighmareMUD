		     The Nightmare IV LPC Library
		     Directory Structure Document
		 written by Descartes of Borg 950419

The directory structure of the Nightmare IV LPC Library is designed to
divide up objects of common functionality and security needs into
logical locations.  The primary distinction is based on security, with
all SECURE objects having a directory structure mirroring that of
non-secure objects.  The non-secure directory structure is built off
the root directory, /.  The secure directory structure is built off
the directory appropriately named /secure.

Both directory structures have the following sub-directories:

/cfg
	Configuration files read by various objects.

/cmds
	Command objects.

/daemon
	Daemon objects.

/doc (non-secure only)
	MUD documentation.

/domains (non-secure only)
	Common domains which are used to join creator realms.

/estates (non-secure only)
	Player built estates.

/ftp (non-secure only)
	Open directory used by the ftp daemon which comes separately.

/include
	Header files used by library objects.

/lib
	Central inheritable and cloneable library objects.

/log (non-secure only)
	Log files for errors and security.

/news (non-secure only)
	MUD news files.

/realms (non-secure only)
	Creator realm files.

/save
	Save files for objects.

/sefun (secure only)
	Simul efun files and objects.

/shadows (non-secure only)
	The only place where the Nightmare IV LPC Library allows
	shadows to come from for security reasons.  You must approve 
	shadows and move them to this directory.
	
/tmp
	Temporary files, such as mail being written, bboard posts, and
	your MUD swap file.

/www (non-secure only)
	WWW files and objects.

The Nightmare IV LPC Library at its core comes in the directories
/cmds, /daemon, /doc, /lib, and /secure.  These are the directories
you as an administrator are most concerned about on a day-to-day
basis.  The unique nature of your MUD is formed mostly through the
files built by creators in /domains and /realms.

It is important that you both understand this directory structure and
the library security in order to have a robust MUD.  The next document
you should read therefore is the Security document.
