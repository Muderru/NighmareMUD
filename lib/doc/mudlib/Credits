The Nightmare LPC Library has a long history dating back to mudlib.n. 
The current version, version 4.2.4, consists of code belonging entirely
to Nightmare LPMud.  Nevertheless, it could not have come to exist
without all the collaboration which has made the LPMud community what
it is.  This document seeks to give credit to those who have written
code appearing in the Nightmare LPC Library as well as to
acknowledge the siginificant contributions of others over the history
of this mudlib, going back to TMI-1 and mudlib.n.  It should be noted
that regardless of authorship, all code in the Nightmare LPC
Library is subject to the copyright and agreement stated in the
Nightmare LPC Library agreement.

The following people have contributed directly to the Nightmare Object
